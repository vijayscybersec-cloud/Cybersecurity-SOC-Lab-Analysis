# 🛡️ Incident Report: Brute Force Attack & Malware Redirection

## 📌 Executive Summary
On February 3, 2026, `yummyrecipesforme.com` experienced a security breach involving unauthorized administrative access and malware distribution. An attacker utilized a **Brute Force attack** to guess a default administrative password, subsequently injecting malicious JavaScript into the website’s source code. This script forced visitors to download an executable file that redirected their browsers to a malicious domain: `greatrecipesforme.com`.

## 🔍 Technical Analysis & Discovery
The incident was identified after customers reported slow system performance and unexpected prompts to download "browser updates" while visiting the site.

### 1. The Attack Vector: Brute Force
The attacker successfully gained entry because the administrative password remained at its **default setting**. The lack of account lockout policies or multi-factor authentication (MFA) allowed the attacker to repeatedly attempt passwords until they gained control of the admin panel.

### 2. Post-Exploitation: Code Injection & Redirection
After gaining access, the attacker performed the following:
* **Code Injection:** Embedded a JavaScript function into the website source code.
* **Malware Deployment:** The script prompted visitors to download and run a file that contained a redirection script.
* **Account Takeover:** The attacker changed the administrative credentials, locking the owner out of the system.

### 3. Traffic Log Analysis (tcpdump)
I analyzed the captured network traffic to document the transition from the legitimate site to the malicious redirect.

**Phase 1: Initial Legitimate Request (YummyRecipesForMe)**
The browser resolves the DNS for the legitimate site and establishes a TCP connection:
```text
14:18:32.192571 IP your.machine.52444 > dns.google.domain: 35084+ A? yummyrecipesforme.com.
14:18:32.204388 IP dns.google.domain > your.machine.52444: 35084 1/0/0 A 203.0.113.22
14:18:36.786501 IP your.machine.36086 > yummyrecipesforme.com.http: Flags [S], seq 2873951608
14:18:36.786589 IP your.machine.36086 > yummyrecipesforme.com.http: Flags [P.], HTTP: GET / HTTP/1.1

**Phase 2: Malicious Redirection (GreatRecipesForMe) The logs confirm the browser being redirected to the attacker's domain after the malware file was executed:**
14:20:32.192571 IP your.machine.52444 > dns.google.domain: 21899+ A? greatrecipesforme.com.
14:20:32.204388 IP dns.google.domain > your.machine.52444: 21899 1/0/0 A 192.0.2.17
14:25:29.576493 IP your.machine.56378 > greatrecipesforme.com.http: Flags [S], seq 1020702883
14:25:29.576590 IP your.machine.56378 > greatrecipesforme.com.http: Flags [P.], HTTP: GET / HTTP/1.1

## 🛠️ Remediation & Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Action Taken
* **Regained Access:** Worked with the hosting provider to reset the hijacked administrative account.
* **Malware Removal:** Sanitized the website source code by removing the injected JavaScript redirect.

### Long-Term Prevention
1. **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** This provides a critical second layer of security that prevents unauthorized access even if a password is breached.
2. **Account Lockout Policy:** Configure the server to block IP addresses after 3–5 failed login attempts to mitigate brute force attacks.
3. **Password Management:** Require all administrative accounts to use unique, complex passwords that are changed regularly.
