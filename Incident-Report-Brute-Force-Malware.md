# 🛡️ Incident Report: Brute Force Attack & Malware Injection

## 📌 Executive Summary
On February 3, 2026, `yummyrecipesforme.com` experienced a security breach resulting in unauthorized administrative access and malware distribution. A former employee exploited a default password via a **Brute Force attack** to inject malicious JavaScript into the website’s source code, redirecting users to a known malware domain: `greatrecipesforme.com`.

## 🔍 Technical Analysis & Discovery
The incident was discovered after multiple customer reports of slow system performance and unexpected browser redirects.

### 1. The Attack Vector: Brute Force
The attacker successfully guessed the administrative password because it had been left at the **default setting**. No account lockout policies or multi-factor authentication (MFA) controls were in place to prevent the automated guessing of credentials.

### 2. Post-Exploitation: Code Injection
After gaining access, the attacker:
* Embedded a **JavaScript function** into the website source code.
* This script prompted visitors to download an executable file disguised as a "browser update".
* The file contained a script that redirected traffic to `greatrecipesforme.com`.



### 3. Traffic Log Analysis (tcpdump)
Using a sandbox environment, I analyzed the network traffic during the redirect.
* **DNS Query:** The system successfully resolved `yummyrecipesforme.com`.
* **HTTP Request:** The browser requested the page, triggering the malicious script.
* **Redirection:** The logs show a second DNS request for `greatrecipesforme.com`, followed by an HTTP request to that malicious IP.

## 🛠️ Remediation & Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Action Taken
* **Account Recovery:** Contacted the hosting provider to regain administrative access.
* **Malware Removal:** Removed the injected JavaScript from the website source code.

### Long-Term Prevention
1. **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** This is the most effective defense against credential-based attacks.
2. **Account Lockout Policy:** Implement a "3-strikes" rule to block IP addresses after multiple failed login attempts.
3. **Password Complexity:** Require unique, non-default passwords for all administrative accounts.
