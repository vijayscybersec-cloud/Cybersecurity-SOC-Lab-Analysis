# 🛡️ Cybersecurity & SOC Analyst Portfolio
Welcome to my technical portfolio. This repository serves as a professional showcase of my transition from **US IT Recruitment** and a **BCA background** into **Security Operations**. Here, I demonstrate my proficiency in network traffic analysis, incident response, system administration, and proactive defense using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**.

---

## ⭐ Featured Projects
*These projects highlight my ability to bridge technical analysis with professional security frameworks.*

* **[DDoS Detection: TCP SYN Flood](./Incident-Report-TCP-SYN-Flood-Analysis.md)**: Deep-dive packet analysis of a multi-stage network attack.
* **[Threat Model: PASTA Framework](./Threat-Model-PASTA-Shopping-App.md)**: Proactive application security modeling for a mobile e-commerce platform.
* **[Internal Security Audit: Botium Toys](./Botium-Toys-Audit.md)**: Full-scale organizational risk assessment using NIST CSF.
* **[Complete Incident Handler's Journal](./Incident-Handlers-Journal-Complete.md)**
    * A master log documenting the analysis of multiple security incidents and the use of professional tools like Wireshark, SQL, and VirusTotal.
    * Aligns technical labs with the four phases of the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle.

## 🚀 Technical Labs & Incident Reports

### 🕵️ Network Traffic & Threat Intelligence
* **[DDoS Detection: TCP SYN Flood](./Incident-Report-TCP-SYN-Flood-Analysis.md)** – Analyzed packet captures to identify incomplete TCP handshakes and resource exhaustion.
* **[Web Compromise: Brute Force & Malware](./Incident-Report-Brute-Force-Malware.md)** – Traced administrative account takeovers and malicious JavaScript redirections in network logs.
* **[Threat Intelligence: VirusTotal & Pyramid of Pain](./Threat-Intelligence-Pyramid-of-Pain.md)** – Pivoted from file hashes to MITRE ATT&CK TTPs to evaluate threat actor difficulty.
* **[DNS Troubleshooting: Port Unreachable](./Incident-Report-DNS-Troubleshooting.md)** – Identified service failures on UDP Port 53 via ICMP error analysis.
* **[Tool Comparison: Wireshark vs. tcpdump](./Network-Analyzer-Comparison.md)** – Comparative analysis of GUI vs. CLI packet sniffers for different operational environments.

### 📑 Incident Response & Playbooks
* **[Phishing Incident Response: Playbook Execution](./Phishing-Incident-Response-Playbook.md)** – Followed standardized SOPs to evaluate, document, and escalate a verified phishing threat.
* **[Incident Handler's Journal: Healthcare Ransomware](./Incident-Handlers-Journal-Ransomware.md)** – Documented a ransomware breach using the "5 W's" framework to ensure business continuity.
* **[NIST CSF Lifecycle Analysis: DoS Event](./NIST-CSF-Incident-Analysis.md)** – Applied the full "Identify-to-Recover" lifecycle to a large-scale ICMP flood incident.
* **[Post-Incident Analysis: E-commerce Data Breach](./Incident-Final-Report-Analysis.md)**
    * Reviewed a final incident report for a major data breach involving 50,000 customer records.
    * Identified "Forced Browsing" as the root cause and recommended URL allowlisting and routine penetration testing to mitigate future web application risks.

### 🏛️ GRC (Governance, Risk, & Compliance)
* **[Vulnerability Assessment: E-commerce Database](./Vulnerability-Assessment-E-commerce.md)** – Conducted qualitative risk scoring (NIST SP 800-30) for a publicly exposed remote server.
* **[Threat Model: PASTA Framework Analysis](./Threat-Model-PASTA-Shopping-App.md)** – mapped data flows and attack trees to secure a sneaker trading application.
* **[Data Leak Prevention: NIST AC-6 Analysis](./Data-Leak-Prevention-NIST-AC6.md)** – Used NIST SP 800-53 controls to remediate insider threat risks and unauthorized sharing.
* **[Bank Risk Assessment & Register](./Risk-Assessment-Bank-Register.md)** – Calculated priority scores for financial assets in a coastal bank operating environment.
* **[Home Office Asset Inventory & Classification](./Asset-Inventory-Risk-Classification.md)** – Cataloged and classified hardware by data sensitivity (Restricted vs. Confidential).

### 🐧 System Admin, IAM & Databases
* **[Linux File Permissions & Hardening](./Linux-Permissions-Security-Lab.md)** – Applied the Principle of Least Privilege using `chmod` and `chown` in a CLI environment.
* **[Access Control Audit: Insider Threat Investigation](./Access-Control-Audit-Lab.md)** – Cross-referenced event logs with HR directories to identify unauthorized account persistence.
* **[SQL Security Filters & Querying](./SQL-Security-Filters-Lab.md)** – Used logical operators and wildcards to investigate after-hours login attempts in database logs.
* **[Social Engineering Analysis: USB Baiting](./USB-Baiting-Security-Analysis.md)** – Analyzed physical "found" media risks using a virtualized sandbox environment.
