# 🛡️ Vulnerability Assessment Report: Remote Database Server

## 📌 Executive Summary
I conducted a vulnerability assessment for an e-commerce company to evaluate the risks associated with a publicly accessible remote database server. This report identifies critical threat sources, evaluates the likelihood and severity of potential security events, and outlines a remediation strategy to secure the organization's data assets.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The primary objective of this assessment is to secure the database server, which contains invaluable customer information and proprietary business data. Because this server has been open to the public for three years, it represents a significant attack surface. If the server were disabled or compromised, it would halt global employee operations, lead to massive data exfiltration, and cause irreparable reputational damage and financial loss.

## 📊 Risk Assessment
Using the **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1** framework, I identified and scored the following risks:

| Threat Source | Threat Event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk Score |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Competitor** | Exfiltration of sensitive customer data to gain market advantage. | 2 | 3 | **6** |
| **Hacker / Outsider** | Denial of Service (DoS) attack to disable business operations. | 3 | 3 | **9** |
| **Malicious Actor** | Unauthorized modification of records (Data Integrity breach). | 2 | 3 | **6** |

---

## 🔍 Approach
My analysis utilized a qualitative assessment to prioritize risks based on the company's unique operating environment. I selected these specific threats because the server is **publicly accessible**, making it a "low-hanging fruit" for outsiders and automated scripts. The high severity scores reflect the catastrophic impact that data loss or system downtime would have on a globally distributed workforce that relies entirely on remote database access.

## 🛠️ Remediation Strategy
To mitigate these risks, I recommend a "Defense in Depth" approach using the following security controls:

1.  **Network Access Control:** Transition the database from the public internet to a private network accessible only via a secure **VPN**.
2.  **The AAA Framework:** Implement the **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)** framework to ensure that only verified employees can access specific data sets.
3.  **Identity Management:** Mandate **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)** for all remote logins to prevent unauthorized access via stolen credentials.
4.  **Least Privilege:** Apply the **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**, ensuring employees can only query the specific data required for their roles.
